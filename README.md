# The Memorise Game
This is a memory game that was coded in python. It will show you 5 numbers, delete them, and then will ask you questions about the numbers. This game is especially hard, if you make the difficulty on Insane. Have fun playing this game. 

## How to start

Simply run the following command

```bash
python main.py
```

## Credits

This is a project I decided working on, because I stumbled across a way to delete python lines that have already been printed.
I believed this was really cool, so I decided to make a game using this method.
